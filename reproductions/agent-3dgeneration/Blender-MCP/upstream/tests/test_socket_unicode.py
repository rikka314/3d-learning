"""Regression coverage for split multi-byte UTF-8 sequences in the socket buffer.

The bug: `_handle_client` accumulates `recv()` chunks into `buffer` and does
`buffer.decode('utf-8')` before attempting `json.loads()`. Only
`json.JSONDecodeError` was caught, treated as "incomplete data, wait for more".
If a multi-byte UTF-8 character (e.g. an accented letter, CJK text, or an
emoji in an object name or in LLM-generated code) is split across a `recv()`
chunk boundary, `.decode('utf-8')` raises `UnicodeDecodeError` instead -
uncaught here, so it falls through to the outer `except Exception`, which
logs and `break`s. The command is dropped and the connection is torn down,
even though the rest of the payload was already sitting in the OS receive
buffer waiting to be read.

A real loopback socket won't reliably reproduce an exact byte-offset split
(the OS may coalesce separate `sendall()` calls into one `recv()`), so this
drives `_handle_client` directly with a fake socket that returns pre-scripted
chunks - deterministic, no network, no flakiness.
